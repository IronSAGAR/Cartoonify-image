# Image to Painting
This project is a fascinating application of Machine Learning and computer vision techniques. It is built using Python and OpenCV. This project can transform normal photos into sketches or paintings. The process involved several stages of image processing, edge detection, color quantization, and combining edge mask on colored images.

Technologies Used:
1. Python
2. OpenCV
3. Machine Learning
